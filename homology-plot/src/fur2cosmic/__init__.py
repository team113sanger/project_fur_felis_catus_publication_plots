# You can single-source your package version setting the package version only in
# the project data in `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`, using `importlib.metadata`.
#
# If your package requires Python 3.8 or above, you can use the standard library
# package `importlib.metadata` and not add a dependency.
#
# If you're supporting versions below 3.8, you need to add a dependency for the
# shim package `importlib-metadata` and import it if `importlib.metadata`
# is not present.
#
# You use the `version()` function to retrieve the version string for a package.
# The value of `__name__` normally provides the package name, but if you're
# running the package as a script (either `python -m my_package` or through
# a script installed with the package), `__name__` will be `"__main__"`,
# in which case you need to use `__package__` to get the package name.
# As far as I can tell there isn't a variable that covers both situations.
#
# Set the package version in your pyproject.toml or setup.py. If you're
# supporting Python versions before 3.8, add a conditional dependency for
# importlib-metadata (examples below).
#
# Choose one of the following code snippets, depending on what Python versions
# your package supports.
# Put the snippet in the __init__.py of your top-level package
